# Reverse Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return  *the reversed list*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

 

 **Follow up:**  A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

    def reverseList(self, head):
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt
        
        return prev
        
```
